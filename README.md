[![Build Status](https://github.com/papablazad/PISP.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/papablazad/PISP.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

**PISP** (short for *Julia Parser of the Integrated System Plan*) is an open-source toolkit for parsing and generating structured datasets of the East Coast Australian Power System for power system studies. 

The data parsing functionalities are built on publicly available information from the Integrated System Plan (ISP) released by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).

> [!CAUTION]
> The current release is fully functional and has been extensively tested; however, bugs or other issues may still arise. We would greatly appreciate any feedback or bug reports submitted via https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/PISP.jl/issues 

## Core function
Dataset construction in PISP is performed through a single high-level function, `build_ISP24_datasets`. A usage example is shown below:
```julia
using PISP

# Set some of the input parameters (see all parameters below)
reference_trace = 4006         # Reference weather trace. 4006 is the one of the Optimal Development Path (ODP) of the ISP
poe             = 10           # Probability of exceedance (POE) for demand
target_years    = [2030, 2031] # Planning years for which to generate datasets

PISP.build_ISP24_datasets(
    downloadpath = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-downloads"),
    poe          = poe,
    reftrace     = reference_trace,
    years        = target_years,
    output_root  = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-datasets"),
    write_csv    = true,
    write_arrow  = false,
    scenarios    = [1,2,3]
    )

```

## Optional parameters for PISP.build_ISP24_datasets()
There are multiple parameters that can be adjusted when generating the dataset from the public 2024 Integrated System Plan (ISP) datafiles:
| Parameter           | Default       | Description                                                                                                                        |
